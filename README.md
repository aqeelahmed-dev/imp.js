Providing e-commerce services and worried about clients not paying? No problem! Follow these steps and ensure your client gets back to you and pays the full charges.

Step 1: Create an Asset
Go to your Shopify admin panel.
Navigate to Online Store > Themes.
Click on Actions > Edit code.
Under the Assets folder, click Add a new asset.
Name the file imp.js and paste the provided custom.js code into this file.
Step 2: Customize the Trigger Date
In the imp.js file, locate the line:
This Line {{ var targetDate = new Date("2024-07-08T00:00:00"); // Replace with your target date }}
Replace "2024-07-08T00:00:00" with your desired trigger date.

Step 3: Include the Script in Your Theme
In the Edit code section, find the layout/theme.liquid file.
Add the following line before the closing </body> tag:
{{ <script src="{{ 'imp.js' | asset_url }}"></script> }}

Final Step: Enjoy the Magic
On the trigger date, your clientâ€™s website will display a restriction message and a link to complete the payment. This ensures your client gets back to you and pays the full charges.

This way, you can protect your services and ensure timely payments from your clients.
